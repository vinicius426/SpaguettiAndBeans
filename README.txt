How to Open the app using Android Studio
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, if nodejs hasn't been installed the best version to get is 14.17.4.
If a newer version has already been installed it's recommended to reinstall
app with the listed version above as the older version supports all of android studio's features.

Secondly, if Android studio (A.S.) hasn't been installed any version is accepted however
version 2020.3.1 is recommended for the best experience, as the release dates between
nodejs 14.17.4 and A.S. are closer.

Before the list of installs appear, there is a prompt to accept the terms and conditions.
After they have been accepted find the version that lists:
Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) Patch 4

Once all of the above applications have been installed successfully
you must be running the emulator from android studio before you
run the command 'npm start' in the command prompt.
