How to Open the app using Android Studio

Setting up Node.js and Android Studio
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, if Nodejs hasn't been installed the best version to get is 14.17.4.
If a newer version has already been installed it's recommended to reinstall the
app with the listed version above as the older version supports all of android studio's features.
https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.17.4/

Secondly, if Android studio (A.S.) hasn't been installed any version is accepted, however
version 2020.3.1 is recommended for the best experience as the release dates between
Nodejs 14.17.4 and A.S. are closer.

Before the list of installs appear, there is a prompt to accept the terms and conditions.
After they have been accepted find the version that lists:
Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) Patch 4
